### Repository Guidance and Rules:
- No one can push directly to a main protected branch; when a repository is published, this rule will be enforced
- Branch out a new dev/feature branch and create a PR to merge your code into a main branch
- Merge your code into the main branch regularly, preferably on a weekly basis, to avoid large PR code blocks for review
